      <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Zahnen Garner</strong>, and I'm a web development student based in Portland, Oregon. I am a self-starting, enthusiastic individual with <em>strong</em> communication, teamworking, problem solving, and multitasking skills. I have a sharp eye for detail and a fervent desire to learn.</br>
    </br>
    I have spent the better part of the last decade in <span class="slightbold">retail</span> or <span class="slightbold">hospitality</span>, with my most recent role focusing specifically on <span class="slightbold">hotel sales & digital marketing</span>. In my experience as a Sales & Marketing Coordinator, I was afforded opportunities to recreate outdated digital materials such as reservation confirmations emails, marketing email templates, and other customer-facing collateral. It was here that I discovered my keen interest in these (relatively small) coding projects.</br>
    </br>
    I've been curious to learn more about coding and web development, and decided to finally make the jump. In committing to a full-time program, I hope to learn all that I possibly can over course of the class and share that progress with the world here.</br>
  </br>
    <em>Outside of work and school, you might find me:</p>

      <li>Baking</li>
      <li>Playing Animal Crossing</li>
      <li>Cuddling my two dogs</li></em>
    </ul>
